# AppleIIMagazineIndex
This is the repository for a website which indexes Apple II magazines such as _II computing_, _Nibble_, _Call Apple_, and _Compute!'s Apple Applications_.  Visit the index [here](https://bikibird.github.io/apple2magazineindex/).

If you have old magazines related to the Apple II, please consider scanning and preserving them on archive.org. This history is too important to lose.

Are your magazines missing from this index? You can fix that by [opening an issue](https://github.com/bikibird/apple2magazineindex/issues/new/choose) to add bibliographic data.  The index will be updated on an at least weekly basis.

Thanks, and enjoy the nostalgia.
